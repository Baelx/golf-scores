# Getting Started with Create React App

Golf Scores is a minimal, client-side score tracking app.

Currently supports:
- up to two players
- up to 18 holes
- par 3 holes

Start by entering the name of the course at the top if desired. Then, there are two inputs for each hole - allowing you to track your putts and total shots.

Score data is kept in local storage. If you close the browser completely, your current data may be lost.

Once finished, you can download the data to your device in the form of a **.csv** file.

## Future updates

If I have time, I'd love to add:

- User accounts for saving course, golfers, and scores
- A DB for persistent storage
- Built-in statistics giving you insights into your play based on the data
